## About
This web app accepts input in both English and Japanese and converts inputs into Morse code. User can also input Morse code (with period `.` as dot or dit, and dash `-` as dash or dah) and it will be convert to the corresponding language.

For Japanese input, it currently accepts both Hiragana and Katakana input. User can also uses [sutegana](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sutegana) /hatsuon /yo-on (such as "„Å£", "„ÇÉ". Sutegana in following text) in the input. They will be convert to their corresponding full-size kana for converting to Morse code.

(Official Japanese Morse code does not support sutegana by default. One would need to interpret the translated text by context. [Google's Morse Code version of Japanese input method](https://www.google.co.jp/ime/-.-.html) solves this problem by attaching the handakuon symbol after a kana to indicate it is a sutegana, but to my knowledge, this is not standard practice.)

## Road Map
While the core features are implemented, there are still improvements to make for this project.

- [x] Update metadata such as Website title and ~~Logos~~ (!important)
- [ ] Change parseJpnInput.js and parseJpnOutput.js to TypeScript functions
    - [ ] add TypeScript config file for the wanakana library
- [x] Add button to copy output to user's clipboard
- [ ] Add support for more dots and dashes inputs for Morse code  (such as `‚Ä¢` and `Ôºç` )
- [ ] Add testing by using Cypress to ensure all functions work fine
